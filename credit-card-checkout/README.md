## Form Submission

## Styling Considerations

- Styling has been kept to a bare minimum
- Most of the focus was on readability while filling out the form
- Inputs/button have been sized large enough to be usable on mobile devices
- Styles are implemented using `styled-components` which can be extensible if theming were ever applicable in the future
- The form has been set to a static width but behaves well for different sizes
- The form is keyboard navigable
